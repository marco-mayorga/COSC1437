COSC-1436

November 11, 2022


Write a function that accepts an int array of grades and the arrayâ€™s size as arguments.
The function should create a new array that is twice the size of the argument array.
The function should copy the contents of the argument array to the new array and initialize the unused elements of the second array with 0.
The function should return a pointer to the new array.
Create a main to demonstrate your function similar or exactly the same as the following.

Sample Output:          Sample Input:

How many grades will be input: 5
Enter Grades: 99 78 45 85 87
Grades: 99 78 45 85 87
Your gradebook has been expanded for more scores:  99 78 45 85 87 0 0 0 0 0
